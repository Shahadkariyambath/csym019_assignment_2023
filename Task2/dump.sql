It allows seamless progression from the Lift and Escalator Technology Certificate/HND into Lift Engineering MSc.\r\n', '\"Access to expert tutorial support and University of Northampton services and facilities.\r\nOnline learning to allow you to study remotely.\r\nUnique, widely recognised and industry-relevant programme\"\r\n', '\"The Lift & Escalator Technology HND covers fundamentals of lift technology and related engineering principles, through engineering design, contract management to more advanced lift or escalator topics. There is some choice within the programme, depending on your particular focus towards lifts or escalators. You will also undertake a project and case study within the programme, both of which are work related.\r\n\r\nThe Certificate in Lift & Escalator Technology satisfies the requirement for three modules on the HNC and HND Lift & Escalator Technology and alternatively has entry points in September and January.\r\n\r\nAll Lift Technology programmes are modular. This HND programme consists of modules, some of which are delivered and assessed by The University of Northampton and some by The Lift & Escalator Industry Association (LEIA).\r\n\r\nThe programme is delivered through distance learning (online) and so no attendance is required. It is therefore specifically designed for those working within the industry while studying at the same time.\r\n\r\nCoursework is used to assess learning and offers the opportunity for you to develop and demonstrate valuable understanding of relevant engineering principles and relevant Codes and Standards, and to apply advanced problem solving, project planning and research skills. Assignments are often related to real life situations and are therefore an important learning activity.\r\n\r\nThe assessment profile for each module has been chosen to ensure that the assessment pattern is the most efficient method of ensuring that you have achieved the learning outcomes of the programme.\"\r\n', 'IELTS 6.0 (or equivalent) with a minimum of 5.5 in all bands\r\n', '\"2023/24 Tuition Fees\r\nFees quoted relate to study in the Academic Year 23/24 only and may be subject to inflationary increases in future years.\r\n\r\nUK – Distance Learning: £920 per 20 Credits\r\nInternational – Distance Learning: £1,175 per 20 Credits\r\nFees for LEIA modules are set by LEIA, and are paid directly to them.\"\r\n', '\"How will I be taught?\r\nThis is an online course allowing you to study wherever is most suitable for you.\r\n\r\nOur virtual learning environment facilitates constant communication between you and course leaders.
